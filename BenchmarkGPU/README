This directory offers a benchmark on GPU with a concrete utilization.
The only thing to do to launch the test is to run "python main.py" on a computer with a GPU.

After initializing the network, the algorithm will apply gradient descents and print the time spent every 100 descents.
The test on the current GPU of the lab gave a result of 100 descents in a mean time of 8s.

Requirements :
- numpy
- tensorflow
